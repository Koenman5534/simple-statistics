# simple-statistics
This webapplication is a small and simpe statistics program that can be implemented in almost every site. 

it is made from four php files:

   1. GetIp.php - get's the visitors IP. 
   2. DatabaseIp.php - Handles the check, insertion and updates for the database and includes the GetIp.php file.
   3. CallData.php - Calls all the data from the database to use on the statistics page itself.
   4. StatisticsPage.php - Contains html and css for some simple styling(this can be changed). This file is responsible for the display of the statistics data. It contains a simple but good looking graph made with Graph.js.
